# bootstrap/ — Seed Data & Demo Content

This directory contains seed data and bootstrap scripts to populate openSME
services with meaningful demo content on a fresh deployment.

## bpmn/

Sample BPMN 2.0 process definitions for the Operaton workflow engine
(`--profile camunda`).

| File | Process key | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `invoice-approval.bpmn` | `opensme-invoice-approval` | Invoice approval: auto-approve ≤ 500, manager approval > 500, archive to File-Cloud on approve, notify on reject |
| `vacation-request.bpmn` | `opensme-vacation-request` | Vacation request: lead approval always, HR approval only for > 3 days, book absence + notify |

Both processes are engine-native (Operaton namespace
`http://operaton.org/schema/1.0/bpmn`) and use `operaton:expression` for
side-effect service tasks plus `operaton:historyTimeToLive` for history
cleanup.

### Deploying

```bash
# Engine running locally (default: auto-detects the opensme-camunda
# container and deploys via docker exec — port 8080 is not published):
./bootstrap/bpmn-deploy.sh

# Engine reachable over HTTP(S) (e.g. behind Traefik):
BPM_URL=https://bpm.example.org ./bootstrap/bpmn-deploy.sh

# or via make:
make bpm-deploy
```

The script waits for the engine to be ready, then deploys every `.bpmn`
file via `POST /engine-rest/deployment/create`. Re-running updates
existing deployments (idempotent).

After deployment, the processes are available in:
- **Cockpit**: `https://bpm.<domain>/operaton/app/cockpit/`
- **Tasklist**: `https://bpm.<domain>/operaton/app/tasklist/`
- **REST API**: `POST https://bpm.<domain>/engine-rest/process-definition/key/<process-key>/start`

### Starting a process instance

```bash
# Invoice approval — manager approval path (> 500):
curl -X POST "https://bpm.<domain>/engine-rest/process-definition/key/opensme-invoice-approval/start" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"variables": {"amount": {"value": 750, "type": "Integer"}, "manager": {"value": "demo", "type": "String"}}, "businessKey": "INV-2026-001"}'

# Vacation request — two-level path (> 3 days):
curl -X POST "https://bpm.<domain>/engine-rest/process-definition/key/opensme-vacation-request/start" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"variables": {"days": {"value": 10, "type": "Integer"}, "teamLead": {"value": "demo", "type": "String"}, "substitute": {"value": "jane", "type": "String"}}, "businessKey": "VAC-2026-001"}'
```

### Completing a user task

```bash
# List open tasks for a user
curl "https://bpm.<domain>/engine-rest/task?assignee=demo"

# Complete the first one (approve):
curl -X POST "https://bpm.<domain>/engine-rest/task/<task-id>/complete" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"variables": {"approved": {"value": true, "type": "Boolean"}}}'
```

### Process variables

| Process | Variable | Type | Purpose |
|---------|----------|------|---------|
| `opensme-invoice-approval` | `amount` | Integer | Routing threshold (> 500 → manager) |
| | `manager` | String | Assignee of the manager approval task |
| | `approved` | Boolean | Set by the manager task |
| `opensme-vacation-request` | `days` | Integer | Routing threshold (> 3 → HR approval) |
| | `teamLead` | String | Assignee of the lead approval task |
| | `substitute` | String | Requested stand-in (informational) |
| | `leadApproved` | Boolean | Set by the team lead (long path) |
| | `approved` | Boolean | Set by the lead (short path) |
| | `hrApproved` | Boolean | Set by HR (long path) |

## Adding more seed data

- **BPMN processes** — drop a `.bpmn` file in `bpmn/` and re-run
  `bpmn-deploy.sh`. Keep the process `id` distinct from the
  `<definitions>` `id` and set `operaton:historyTimeToLive` on the
  `<process>` element, or Operaton rejects the deployment.
- **Portal banners** — set `PORTAL_ANNOUNCEMENTS` in `.env` to a JSON
  array of `{"level":"info|warn","text":"…"}` objects.

## seed-content/

Human-readable sample documents for your document store (Cloud /
Paperless) and as reference for operators. Not boot-consumed and never run
in CI — see `seed-content/README.md` for how to load each file.
